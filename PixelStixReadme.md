# What are PixelStix and how do I use them? 
PixelStix is a computing platform that is used for adding digital content to physical objects and public spaces. 

You'll need to get your hands on a PixelStix to add a pixelscript to them. They are small computers that don't use batteries or electricity and usually look like a sticker. You can purchase them at https://www.pixelstix.com/. To interact with a PixelStix, download the free PixelStix for Android or iOS.

Because a PixelStix does not require electricity to operate they are often added to outdoor public spaces. Inside the PixelStix app you will see the `Maps` where you can see the maps of various outdoor PixelStix you can find and interact with.

The basic instruction for interacting with a PixelStix are:

- Open the PixelStix app
- Tap the P
- Touch your phone to the PixelStix

If you are going to be assigning and re-assigning content follow these steps

- Tap the gear and then `settings` in the PixelStix app to register an account
- Tap the gear and then `manage`
- Touch your phone to the PixelStix
- Select how you'd like to manage the way this PixelStix behaves (assign content, add it to a map, set alias, clear and release, etc)

*note: You can upload videos or images from your phone to a PixelStix and that is a really cool thing to do with them but to use the pixelscripts in this repo you'll always be assigning them as Links*
